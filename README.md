## Making a new device driver

To make your own libhal library:

1. press the green "Use this Template" button then
2. press the "Create a new repository".
3. Name it `libhal-<insert_device_name>` and replace `<insert_device_name>` with
  the name of the device's family. For exmaple, if you want to make a library
  for the MPU series of IMUs then call it `libhal-mpu`.
4. Choose where to put the repo under,
5. Go to `settings` > `Pages` > `Build and deployment` > `Source` and set the
  source to `Github Actions`.
6. Go to `Pull Requests` and merge the library rename pull request.
7. Done!

## About the libhal-device template

The libhal-__device__ repository is a template for creating device libraries in
the libhal ecosystem. It provides a structured layout and a set of files to help
you get started with creating your own device library.

## .github/workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow files for continuous integration
(CI) and other automated tasks. The workflows currently included are:

- `ci.yml`: This workflow runs the CI pipeline, which includes
  building the project, running tests, and deploying the library to the
  `libhal-trunk` package repository.
- `take.yml`: This workflow is responsible for the "take" action, which assigns
  commits to
- `update_name.yml`: This workflow updates the name of the repository when it's
  used as a template for a new repository.

## conanfile.py

This is a [Conan](https://conan.io/) recipe file. Conan is a package manager for
C and C++ that helps manage dependencies in your project. This file defines how
Conan should build your project and its dependencies.

## datasheets

This directory is intended for storing datasheets related to the device that the
library is being built for. It currently contains a placeholder file,
`put_datasheets_here.md`.

Many datasheets are subject to copyright and that must be considered when adding
the datasheet to a libhal repo. If the datasheet cannot be redistributed on the
repo for copyright and/or license reasons, then a markdown file with a link to
the datasheet (and potentially mirrors of it) is an acceptable alternative.

## demos

This directory contains demonstration applications showing how to use the device
library. It includes:

- `applications/__device__.cpp`: A sample application demonstrating usage of the
  device library.
- `hardware_map.hpp`: A header file defining the hardware map for the demo
  applications.
- `main.cpp`: The main entry point for the demo applications.
- `platforms/lpc4074.cpp` and `platforms/lpc4078.cpp`: Platform-specific
  implementations for the demo applications.

## include/libhal-__device__

This directory contains the header files for the device library. It currently
includes `__device__.hpp`, which is a placeholder for the main header file of
your device library.

## src

This directory contains the source files for the device library. It currently
includes `__device__.cpp`, which is a placeholder for the main source file of
your device library.

## test_package

This directory contains a test package for the Conan recipe. It includes a
simple application that uses the device library, which helps verify that the
Conan recipe is working correctly.

## tests

This directory contains tests for the device library. It includes:

- `__device__.test.cpp`: A placeholder for tests for the device library.
- `main.test.cpp`: The main entry point for the tests.

Remember to replace all instances of `__device__` with the actual name of the
device that your library is being built for.
